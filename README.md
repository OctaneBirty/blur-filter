# blur-filter
The blur filter from the streamFX plugin packaged on it's own.

I take zero credit for the source code provided on this repository. This is just the blur filter from the streamFX plugin for
those who want a standalone version. All credit goes to the original author Xaymar.

Installation:
1) Run the installer
2) Select your obs-studio installation folder, the default is already set as C:\Program Files\obs-studio
3) Open OBS and add a "Blur" filter to whatever source you want to blur.
